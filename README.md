## Objective

To build a reliable and interpretable ML system that assists financial institutions in making data-driven loan approval decisions while minimizing risk.

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed and evaluated multiple classification models for loan approval prediction. Based on performance comparison, the best-performing model demonstrated strong recall and balanced precision, making it suitable for minimizing risky loan approvals. The system provides a practical framework for real-world credit risk assessment.

## Future Improvements

* Perform hyperparameter tuning to further improve model performance.

* Experiment with advanced ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

* Implement model explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP or LIME) for better interpretability.

* Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time loan approval predictions.
